summary: Understanding the role of a reference manager
title: Why you need a reference manager
---

# What is a reference manager?

A reference manager is typically a computer application that stores references and allows you to easily cite them in documents, e.g., word. 

# What are the benefits?

For psychology students, it is not uncommon to produce an assignment with more than 20 references. Without a reference manager, it would be difficult to keep track of each reference you have used and time-consuming to put each of these into a bibliography. A reference manager typically has a webclipper that allows you to save an article or webpage while you search the web. Once it is saved, the article can then be easily cited in a word processor, e.g., word. This saves you a tonne of time and allows you to easily access references. Below is an example of my reference manager. I have put each reference in a folder for each assignment. This allows me to have ease-of-access when organising and examining each reference.

In addition, most reference managers allow you to create notes of each saved article. Here you would be able to write some brief notes of each reference; for example, when I need to do something else but realise the article is important, I use a word system to organise importance (Gold Standard, Silver Standard, and Bronze Standard). When I go back to the folder, I can see which articles I need to prioritise regarding reading.

# Which reference manager do I recommend?

Hands down, I recommend Zotero. Zotero is not only open source (free) but it is constantly updated and improved. It has a webclipper, a pdf editor, and seamlessly integrates with word and libre office. Overall, Zotero has saved me hours of wasting my time formatting references by hand.
