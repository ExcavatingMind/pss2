Currently I have plans to produce a free ebook documenting learning processes to improve student's grades. From my experiences as a tutor, I have seen common issues that psychology students have. One example is statistical comprehension which is the focus of my R and Stats project.

However, another issue refers to learning, documenting, and displaying information in written and verbal format. In the coming months, I will layout a micro-white paper that further explains what I will attempt to accomplish with the ebook on my excavatin-gmind.netlify.app/ website.
