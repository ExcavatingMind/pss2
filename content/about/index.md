title: About me
---

I am a current MRes psychology and data science student who aims to conduct a PhD in the 2023 academic year. I have broad interests including transdiagnostic interventions, open science, mental health and data science, and improving physical and mental health.

In my spare time, I like to learn about psychology research, play chess, and converse with friends and family.

My current goals are to achieve a distinction in my MRes, get onto a PhD studentship program, and get some teaching experience in higher education settings.
