Philosophy of psychology concerns questions such as "what is psychology?", "what makes psychology a     science?", and "how can we improve psychological research?". Broadly, this discipline can be seen as meta-psychology, or thinking about psychology. 

When we conduct psychological research it is important to understand what, how, and why we are attempting to accomplish something.
